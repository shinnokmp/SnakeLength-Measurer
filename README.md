# üêç Snake Measurer Tool

Inspired by the previously existing SerpWidgets,com, I decided to develop a similar efficient tool to help herpetologists and those working on snakes, just as myself to estimate the length of a snake, especially the venomous species which may prove difficult to handle easily.
This tool allows you to measure the real-world length of a snake in a photograph by referencing a visible scale (e.g., a ruler or tape) in the same image. It supports curved path measurements along the snake's body for higher accuracy.

## üì∏ Image Preparation Guidelines

To ensure accurate measurements, please follow these steps when taking your photo:

1. **Include a Scale in the Same Plane**:
   - Place a **ruler, measuring tape, or known-length object** (e.g., a 10 cm card) **next to the snake**, on the **same horizontal plane**.
   - Make sure the scale is **fully visible** in the image.

2. **Lay the Snake as Straight as Possible**:
   - Gently guide the snake into a relatively straight or gently curved posture.
   - Avoid overlapping or tight coils, as it makes accurate tracing difficult.

3. **Take the Photo From Directly Above**:
   - Capture the photo from a **bird‚Äôs-eye view** (90¬∞ angle).
   - Avoid angled shots or zooming with perspective distortion.

4. **Ensure Good Lighting and Focus**:
   - The image should be **clear and in focus**.
   - Avoid shadows or blur around the snake or the scale.

## üñ± How to Use the Tool

1. **Upload Image**:
   - Click the file upload input and select your image.

2. **Set Scale**:
   - Click **two points** along the **known-length object** in the image (e.g., from 0 to 10 cm on a ruler).
   - Enter the **real-world distance in centimeters** when prompted.

3. **Trace the Snake**:
   - Click along the snake‚Äôs body in **small segments** from head to tail (or vice versa).
   - Click **carefully along curves** to approximate the full body path.

4. **Undo a Point**:
   - **Right-click** anywhere on the canvas to remove the **last traced point** (undo).

5. **Finish Tracing**:
   - When you're done tracing, **double-click** to complete measurement.
   - The tool will calculate and display the **total snake length in centimeters**.

6. **Reset**:
   - Use the **Reset** button to start over with a new trace or image.

## üõ† Technical Notes

- This tool runs entirely in your browser‚Äîno image or data is uploaded.
- Measurements are based on the **scale you define**, so accuracy depends on the quality and setup of your input image.
